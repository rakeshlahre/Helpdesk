An app that will allow clients to connect their twitter accounts, fetch tweets and reply to tweets within the
application.

### Development
1. `npm run install-all`
    * Installs dependencies in base and server-frontend directory
2. `npm start`: (*This should be sufficient to start the app for development*)
    * This runs two scripts: `npm run server`, `npm run serve`. Open `http://localhost:8081`
